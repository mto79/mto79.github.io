      <description>After setting up my workstation in a totally different way (building my own immutable OS in a GitHub based repository based on Fedora Silverblue 31) which i will describe in another post it is time to setup a server based device for learning and developing some new devops, CI/CD principals.
The first thing is to make some choices for this prototype of a home lab.</description>

      <description>Semper exploro (&amp;ldquo;I am always exploring&amp;rdquo;) is the motto of this personal blog. It is also a line which can be found on a Earth Starfleet Command Emblem from the series Star Trek Enterprise. Which, i love to watch!
In the day time i&amp;rsquo;m doing professional exploration for The National Archives of the Netherlands. Working for an institution like this makes you aware, that sometimes you want to register and share some piece of information with others or with yourself (for that matter) in a latter point of time.</description>
