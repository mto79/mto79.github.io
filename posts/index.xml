      <description>Recently i decided to bring up a vm on the Hetzner Cloud in addition to my local lab environment. I don&amp;rsquo;t want my local lab environment to be always online for security and power consumming reasons, but i need some services that do. For example i want Wireguard for VPN and Nginx for serving content like ignition files.
Because i like Fedora, immutable filesystems and i am really diving into k3s, i want to deploy Fedora CoreOS on Hetzner Cloud.</description>

      <description>Semper exploro (&amp;ldquo;I am always exploring&amp;rdquo;) is the motto of this personal blog. It is also a line which can be found on a Earth Starfleet Command Emblem from the series Star Trek Enterprise. Which, i love to watch!
In the day time i&amp;rsquo;m doing professional exploration for The National Archives of the Netherlands. Working for an institution like this makes you aware, that sometimes you want to register and share some piece of information with others or with yourself (for that matter) in a later point of time.</description>
